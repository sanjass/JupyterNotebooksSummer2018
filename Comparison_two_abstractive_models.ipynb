    "Eni Agrees Lower Costs for Indonesian Gas Field\n",
    "2018/03/29\n",
    "Eni has reduced expected costs for its Merakes gas field development offshore Indonesia by around 14% to \\$1.03 billion after its original development plan was rejected by the government as too expensive, an official with the country's energy ministry has told International Oil Daily.\n",
    "The Italian major's plan for Merakes was submitted to the energy ministry for approval earlier this month, with an estimated budget of around $1.2 billion.\n",
    "But with the government on the hook to reimburse Eni for development costs, the ministry asked Eni to revise its plans and come back with a lower figure (IOD Mar.23'18).\n",
    "\"The energy ministry has reviewed the cost of the Merakes project and Eni has agreed with the results.\n",
    "Eni will soon propose a new development plan,\" the official, who declined to be named, told IOD on Wednesday.\n",
    "While it remains unclear how the cost savings were found or whether some compromise was reached, the swift progress toward a new development plan underlines Jakarta's determination to keep Merakes on track to help it offset falling output from other fields, and Eni's desire to make progress with one of six projects penciled in for a final investment decision (FID) this year as part of broader push to develop its gas and power portfolio (EIF Mar.21'18).\n",
    "The ministry now expects Eni to take FID on Merakes by May, assuming there are no other major obstacles, the official said.\n",
    "\"The energy ministry wants Merakes to come on stream in 2019.\n",
    "That target is still in line with the development plan,\" the official said.\n",
    "Eni spokesman Filippo Cotalini declined to comment on the development plan but said the company “will communicate a possible update on Merakes in due time.”\n",
    "Merakes, located in the Sepinggan Block off East Kalimantan, is expected to produce about 150 million cubic feet per day of gas, which will be supplied to the Bontang LNG plant, and is estimated to hold around 2 trillion cubic feet of reserves.\n",
    "Eni has an 85% operating interest while state-run Pertamina holds 15% (IOD Jun.26'17).\n",
    "Eni's development plan envisages a new platform linked to a floating production unit and other pipeline facilities, according to the energy ministry.\n",
    "The energy ministry's newly appointed director general of oil and gas, Djoko Siswanto, told reporters on Wednesday that he would ensure that the Merakes project proceeds smoothly in order to meet the planned start-up date.\n",
    "Changes to the country's production-sharing contract model have deterred investors, who say Indonesia's fiscal terms are becoming less attractive and more stringent, exacerbating the problems caused by lower oil and gas prices.\n",
    "Several companies including Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Hess have divested or walked away from assets in recent years, and there is still uncertainty over the timing of FIDs for several major upstream projects, including Inpex's Abadi project, and Chevron's Gendalo-Gehem field (IOD Mar.6'18).\n",

    "The well was drilled to a total depth of 18,445 feet in 5,912 feet of water.\n",
    "The well was completed on Sep. 29.\n",
    "The successful well adds to discoveries to date at the Liza, Payara, Snoek and Liza Deep prospects.\n",
    "However, despite the string of promising finds, Guyana is still working to lay the foundations of its oil and gas sector.\n",
    "After the state took public comment over the summer on a draft petroleum law, the bill itself is still sitting in committee in the country’s parliament, awaiting legislators’ next moves.\n",
    "In speaking to local press outfit Oil Now, Natural Resource Minister Raphael Trotman said Guyana had yet to even figure out who will market its oil, even though production is slated to commence in 2020.\n",
    "Estimates from Oil Now suggest the government take on the very first day of production in 2020 would be just under \\$900,000 at current barrel prices.\n",
    "The calculation is based on projected output of 120,000 b/d, as well as a negotiated 2% royalty and 50% \"profit oil\" share.\n",
