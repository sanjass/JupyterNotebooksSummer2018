    " \n",
    "ElasticSearch is a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine. It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time. It is generally used as the underlying engine/technology that powers applications that have complex search features and requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general features of Elasticsearch are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Elasticsearch is scalable up to petabytes of structured and unstructured data.\n",
    "- Elasticsearch can be used as a replacement of document stores like MongoDB and RavenDB.\n",
    "- Elasticsearch uses denormalization to improve the search performance.\n",
    "- Elasticsearch is one of the popular enterprise search engines, which is currently being used by many big organizations like Wikipedia, The Guardian, StackOverflow, GitHub etc.\n",
    "- Elasticsearch is open source and available under the Apache license version 2.0.\n",

    "In our index named \"sentences\" we are mainly indexing sentences, along with some other fields which further help us understand the context and properties of the sentence. These fields together with the sentence field form a document in an index in ElasticSearch. The act of putting these documents from one's computer to the ElasticSearch server is called \"indexing\".

From the query we can see that at least two of the three match-clauses should be satisfied in order for a document to be returned as a result. Moreover, when scoring the documents, we give more importance to the \"named_entities\" field by using the \"boost\" parameter. As a simple example, the sentence *\"New Zealand is a country of stunning and diverse natural beauty\"* would be scored higher than *\"In India, a policy to encourage enhanced oil and gas recovery projects was established to arrest declining production in the country\".* However, the sentence *\"Earlier, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern released a statement saying that there would be \"no further offshore oil and gas exploration permits granted.\"\"* would be scored higher than both of the previous sentences.\n",

More importantly, we want words like \"Gulf of Mexico\" to have the same meaning as their abbreviations \"GoM\".\n",
    "We can incorporate synonyms into elasticsearch by configuring a \"synonym\" analyzer. We can construct the synonym file ourselves, and the format is as follows:\n",

    "malaysia => malaysia, southeast asia, south asia, asia\n",
    "brazil => brazil, south america, latin america, americas, america\n",
    "nigeria => nigeria, west africa, africa\n",
    "mexico => mexico, southern north america, north america, americas, america\n",
    "liberia => liberia, west africa, africa\n",
    "uruguay => uruguay, southeastern south america, south america, americas, america\n",

Read more [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/synonyms-expand-or-contract.html). \n",
    "For example, above, \"gom, gulf of mexico\" means that the two words are completely synonymous. If we search for \"GoM\" we should get the same results as if we search \"Gulf of Mexico\". On the other hand, \"malaysia => malaysia, southeast asia, south asia, asia\" is called genre explansion. Instead of treating all synonyms as equal, genre expansion widens the meaning of a term to be more generic. If we search \"Malasya\" we'd get results solely about Malasya. If we search for \"Southeast Asia\" we'd get results about Southeast Asia AND Malasya. Another possibility which we haven't used yet is simple contraction, such as \"United States => US\". Note that if a document is indexed using this rule, any occurence of \"United States\" would be converted to \"US\". Then, if we search for \"US\" we'd get results for both \"US\" and \"United States\" but if we search for \"United States\" we wouldn't find matches as in our index the phrase \"United States\" has been converted to \"US\".\n",
